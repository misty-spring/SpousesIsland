## Language codes
The game assigns language codes to each language avaiable; (almost) every file has an alternative in that language with its corresponding extension/filename (for example, `NPCDispositions` has versions in all languages, while the files in `"Characters/schedules"` doesn't. This is because schedule files don't depend on any dialogue / are the same regardless of language.) 

As i said before, translation support will be added soon to the mod- so i'd *really* suggest waiting for that (as translation support means you will only need one content pack for all languages). However, if you don't want to wait, the extensions are the following:

filename/extension | language
---- | -------
`.de-DE` | German
`.es-ES` | Spanish
`.fr-FR` | French
`.hu-HU` | Hungarian
`.it-IT` | Italian
`.ja-JP` | Japanese
`.ko-KO` | Korean
`.pt-BR` | Portuguese
`.ru-RU` | Russian
`.tr-TR` | Turkish
`.zh-CN` | Chinese
