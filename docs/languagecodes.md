## Language codes
The game assigns language codes to each language avaiable; (almost) every file has an alternative in that language with its corresponding extension/filename (for example, `NPCDispositions` has versions in all languages, while the files in `"Characters/schedules"` doesn't. This is because schedule files don't depend on any dialogue / are the same regardless of language.) 

The mod currently has translation support ([see here for more info]()). These are the avaiable language codes (The mod will recognize them and patch correspondingly):

code | language
---- | -------
`de` | German
`es` | Spanish
`fr` | French
`hu` | Hungarian
`it` | Italian
`ja` | Japanese
`ko` | Korean
`pt` | Portuguese
`ru` | Russian
`tr` | Turkish
`zh` | Chinese

Keep in mind the language code has to be the exact same; if you make a typo, the mod will interpret it as a custom language.
